I am learning about web workers. The premise makes sense but I am curious about the performance bottlenecks that would crop up by a web worker spawning more workers?

What happens with this when you are on a low spec PC with maybe two processor cores and you're spawning multiple threads. Is there a way to handle this? I assume there to be a cap on the amount of workers you can spawn. Interesting stuff.

## Vite, Supabase, and TailwindCSS

I've also spent the cash for [Neetcode Pro](https://neetcode.io/). If you aren't familiar with [Neetcode's YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/NeetCode?app=desktop), I highly recommend it.

TL;DR of Neetcode:

He spent a ridiculous amount of time solving Leetcode problems on YouTube for free and ended up getting a job at Google.

He has a cheap Pro version of the site[^1] that you can pay *once* for[^2].

I also paid $20 for [Fireship's Supabase course](https://fireship.io/courses/supabase/), which I am excited about.


[^1]: $129 on sale which ends today for lifetime access, $199 when the sale is over. Or you could pay $99/yr. If I wasn't so broke while job searching I'd have given him $99/yr without hesitating.
[^2]: I pay so much for AlgoExpert yearly as they're big enough to separate their tracks into algorithms, frontend, and system design. I can't afford all three and just have the algorithms and frontend experts. Neetcode has the algorithms and system design courses I need, which reduces my need for AlgoExpert's courses.
