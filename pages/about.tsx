          I like teaching people things that I know. I like video games,
          running, and reading.

          I am easily impressed by people and the cool stuff that they build. I
          read a lot of technical blogs. If we've ever interacted,
          I've visited your website and probably think it's cool!
        </p>
        <p>Technical books I recommend include Crafting Interpreters, and The Computational Beauty of Nature. Non-tech authors I recommend include Patricia Lockwood and Ben Lerner. In my undergrad, I mostly studied post-WWII fiction.</p>
        <p>I prefer cold days, and drink coffee every day.</p>
