Hi! I'm tiff from [tiff's blog](https://tiffanywhite.dev).

I rebuilt my blog with Next.js and MDX. Because of how many times I moved the posts around, so many posts are broken and not working with the MDX format.

So since I'm not going to fix them, I'm just going to archive them here. I *still* want them on the internet because I think they're useful and important because of the opportunities they gave me. But I've been writing this blog, in various forms, for almost 10 years. I am a better software engineer and it feels apt that I move on from the earlier posts.

Questions? Comments? [Email me](mailto:tiffany@tiffanyrwhite.com) or ping me on [Mastodon](https://hachyderm.io/@tiff).
